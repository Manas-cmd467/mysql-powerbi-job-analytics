- 🧩 **Normalization** — Merged and aligned multiple data sources under one schema  
- 🧼 **Cleaning** — Removed duplicates, nulls, and invalid records  
- 🧠 **Categorization (Power BI M-Code)**  
  - Derived `Job_employment_type` from keywords like *full-time*, *contract*, *internship*, etc.  
  - Classified `Job_title` into consistent categories (e.g., *Data Analyst*, *Cloud Engineer*, *Software Engineer*) using Power Query conditional logic  
- ⚙️ **Optimization** — Chunk-based inserts to handle >700,000 rows efficiently in Python
